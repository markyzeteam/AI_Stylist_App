# Body Shape Advisor Fixes

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Shopify CLI version outdated** - Updated to 3.85.2
2. **App permissions error** - Created new app with valid client ID
3. **Missing locales directory** - Created `extensions/body-shape-advisor/locales/en.default.json`
4. **Invalid schema presets** - Removed `presets` key from app block schema
5. **Parser-blocking script** - Changed to `<script defer>` instead of `script_tag`
6. **Body shape calculation always returning Rectangle** - Fixed unrealistic thresholds

## Files Modified:
- `extensions/body-shape-advisor/blocks/body-shape-advisor.liquid`
- `extensions/body-shape-advisor/locales/en.default.json` (created)
- `app/utils/bodyShape.ts`

## New Thresholds:
- Pear: hips 7+ cm larger than waist, bust 5+ cm smaller than hips
- Hourglass: bust/hips within 8cm, both 8+ cm larger than waist
- Apple: bust <10cm larger than waist
- Inverted Triangle: bust/shoulders 5+ cm larger than hips

## Commands Used:
```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
shopify app dev --reset
```

## How to Reconnect Shopify App Later:

### 1. Navigate to project
```bash
cd C:\Users\POST.DESKTOP-THLFI3B.000\yze-shopping-ai
```

### 2. Start development server
```bash
shopify app dev
```

### If authentication errors:
```bash
shopify auth logout
shopify auth login
shopify app dev
```

### If app not found:
```bash
shopify app dev --reset
```
(Note: This creates a new app - you'll need to reinstall it in your store)

### Quick Reference:
- **Normal startup**: `shopify app dev`
- **Login issues**: `shopify auth logout` → `shopify auth login` → `shopify app dev`
- **App not found**: `shopify app dev --reset`
